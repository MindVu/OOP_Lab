If we attempt to create a duplicate method (constructor) in Java, it is identified as an error and Java notifies us of the duplication to prevent issues from occurring later on. However, when testing these duplicated constructors using the Aims.java file, we receive warnings of errors in the AimsProject but are still given the option to proceed with launching the program. When the program is launched, the "title" attribute is successfully filled but the "category" attribute is set to null. This occurs because the constructor for "title" takes precedence over the constructor for "category".
